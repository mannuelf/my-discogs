# MyDiscogs - React Remix App

MyDiscogs is a React client to display all the "for sale" items in a sellers inventory using the [Discogs API](https://www.discogs.com/developers).

To see the contents of a specific seller you must add the seller name to environment variable: `SELLER_USERNAME`

## Environment variables

```sh
ACCESS_TOKEN_URL=https://api.discogs.com/oauth/access_token
AUTHORIZE_URL=https://www.discogs.com/oauth/authorize
CONSUMER_KEY=
CONSUMER_SECRET=
REQUEST_TOKEN_URL=https://api.discogs.com/oauth/request_token
SELLER_USERNAME=
USER_AGENT=yourAppName/1.0 +http://localhost:5173
```

Get your consumer key and secret from [Discogs API](https://www.discogs.com/developers)

## Development

```sh
pnpm i
```

Run the dev server:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
pnpm build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
pnpm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.
